        Pineapple Fried Rice is of Thai origin, though there’s iterations of it all around the world. While some recipes use little more than a dash of soy sauce, this is a recipe that stays true to the Thai way and will evoke memories of warm balmy evenings in Thailand, eating at beach shack diners with your toes squidging in the sand, sipping on fruit cocktail
    </h2>
<p>
    Here’s what you need to make Pineapple Fried Rice – the Thai way (the best way!). While it is of course best to make this with fresh pineapple when they’re ripe and at their prime, canned is perfectly acceptable (and a heck of a lot faster to prep!).

<ul>
    <li>Green Onion</li>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
    <li>Fish Sauce</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Pineapple</li>
    <li>Peas</li>
    <li>Capsicum</li>

    3 Thai Sauce Options
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Fish sauce + Oyster sauce
        </strong>
             – truly authentic Thai, terrific caramelisation / depth of flavour. In fact, purists say it’s “illegal” to use soy sauce in Thai cooking. That if you do, it’s Chinese food not Thai!
            </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Soy sauce + Oyster sauce</strong>
             – typically thought of as Thai homestyle.
            </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Soy sauce + Maggi seasoning*
        </strong>
         - commonly used by Thai restaurants outside of Thailand.
        </li>
</ul>

    How to make Pineapple Fried Rice
</h2>
<p>
    It’s nice and quick to make – everything is just fried up in a skillet or wok. Use a large one so you can toss enthusiastically because that’s the key to reducing the sauce down and making it almost “caramelise” the rice grains which = flavour!
